# Contributor Information Management using SortingHat

[SortingHat](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat/tree/muggle) is a part of
the GrimoireLab toolset and is used to gather data related to contributor information.
Data about each individual is stored as a unique profile which may or may not include
several identities belonging to the same contributor. Moreover each individual can be
affiliated with a particular organisation where the latter was employed.

SortingHat is currently being converted into a service so the documentation at the
**[master](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat)** branch would be totally
inaccurate. The on-going development is carried out at the
**[muggle](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat/tree/muggle)** branch.
