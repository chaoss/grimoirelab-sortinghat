# Contributor Information Management using SortingHat

[SortingHat](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat/tree/muggle) is a part of the GrimoireLab toolset and is used to gather data related to contributor information. Data about each individual is stored as a unique profile which may or may not include several identities belonging to the same contributor. Moreover each individual can be affiliated with a particular organisation where the latter was employed.

SortingHat is currently being converted into a service so the documentation at the <strong>[master](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat)</strong> branch would be totally inaccurate. The on-going development is carried out at the <strong>[muggle](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat/tree/muggle)</strong> branch.
