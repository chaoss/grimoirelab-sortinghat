# Contributor Information Management using SortingHat

[SortingHat](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat) is a part of
the GrimoireLab toolset and is used to gather data related to contributor information.
Data about each individual is stored as a unique profile which may or may not include
several identities belonging to the same contributor. Moreover each individual can be
affiliated with a particular organisation where the latter was employed.
