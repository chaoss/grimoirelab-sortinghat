# Difference between profiles and identities

Each individual will have a unique profile which may or may not consists of several
identities. A profile is unique to one particular individual, that is no-one will have the
same profile with the same information (Name, Email, Username, Affiliations etc... )

For example, you can think of **profiles as human beings**. Every human being is
different, hence unique. If that person goes to the bank and creates an account, he'll be
given an account card. That is one of his identities, a customer of the bank.

As you can see, there is a single individual and that individual has several identities
which are listed below
