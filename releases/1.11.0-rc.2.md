**New features:**

 * Recommendations based on GitHub-generated email addresses (#867)\
   Merge recommendations can now match GitHub profiles to GitHub-
   generated emails (<username>@users.noreply.github.com). Individuals
   can also be automatically unified with this criteria.
 * Increased minimum version for Python to 3.10\
   Python 3.9 reaches the end of life in October 2025. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   GrimoireLab supports Python 3.10 and higher from now on.
