## sortinghat 1.12.1 - (2025-10-31)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Task update issues due to type mismatch\
   Fix a bug that caused updating and deleting tasks from the UI to fail.
   The GraphQL Task type now uses an ID field that accepts both integers
   and strings, but the UI had not been updated to handle this change.
 * Importer failed to reschedule tasks\
   Fix a bug that prevented the importer from rescheduling tasks because
   `from_date` was not JSON serializable when inserting into the
   database.
 * Unify periodic task param issue\
   Fixed an issue where creating a unify periodic task with "Guess GitHub
   User‚Äù enabled failed.
 * Importing identities with oversized fields failed\
   Fix a bug where importing identities with a large field (e.g.,
   username) caused the whole process to fail. Now, such identities are
   skipped instead.
