title: Last run of scheduled tasks

  The information about the last run of scheduled tasks on the
  user interface was not coherent when there was more than one
  'affiliate' and 'unify' task. Now, the system only allows to
  schedule one recurrent task of each of those types and the
  user interface shows the correct date.
