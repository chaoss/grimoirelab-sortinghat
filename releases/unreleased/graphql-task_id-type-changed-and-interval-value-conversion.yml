title: GraphQL task_id type changed and interval value conversion
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  Updated task_id fields in DeleteScheduledTask and UpdateScheduledTask
  to use graphene.ID() instead of graphene.Int(). In Graphene v3, this
  caused type errors because a string value was being passed instead of
  an integer.

  Also converted interval values to numbers in the ImporterModal and
  SettingsGeneral components to prevent similar type errors, since
  Graphene v3 expects numeric values instead of strings.
