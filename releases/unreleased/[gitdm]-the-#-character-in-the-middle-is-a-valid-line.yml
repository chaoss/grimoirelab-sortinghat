title: '[gitdm] The # character in the middle is a valid line'
category: fixed
author: Quan Zhou <quan@bitergia.com>

notes: >
    Accepts the `#` character in the middle of the line,
    but it will be skipped.

    For example:
    - user@domain.com #Chaoss
    - user@domain.com Chaos#s
    - user@domain.com Chaoss < 2015-03-01#
