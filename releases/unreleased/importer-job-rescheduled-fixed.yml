title: Importer job rescheduled fixed
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>

notes: >
  Fixes a bug that caused the importer to always use the same
  start date when importing identities after being rescheduled.
  It now uses the start date of the current job as from_date
  for the next execution.
