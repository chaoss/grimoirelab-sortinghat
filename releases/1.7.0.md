## sortinghat 1.7.0 - (2025-04-09)

**New features:**

 * More detailed individual information  when reviewing recommendations (#936)\
   The "Review recommendations" functionality now shows a list of the
   individuals' usernames and email addresses to help compare them more
   easily without needing to expand the information each time.
 * Renamed recommendations view labels (#954)\
   The text of the buttons on the recommendations view was changed to
   make the actions to be performed clearer.
 * Improved session cookie security\
   Session cookies are now sent with the `Secure` attribute to protect
   them from attacks. By default, the cookies expire after 30 minutes of
   user inactivity. This configuration can be changed in the
   `settings.py` file.
 * More icons for sources\
   The user interface now has icons for Confluence, Jenkins, Phabricator,
   Meetup and Gerrit. This prevents from grouping them into "other
   sources".

**Bug fixes:**

 * Wrong order of affiliations (#955)\
   Multiple affiliations to the same company caused a wrong order in the
   list of organizations at the individual's profile. All affiliations
   are now sorted by date.
