## sortinghat 1.10.0-rc.1 - (2025-08-18)

**New features:**

 * Post processing of imported individuals\
   The new method `post_process_individual` allows to post-process
   individuals after they are imported. For example, you might want to
   merge the imported identities with others already existing using
   custom criteria, or to set the profile of the new identities in using
   specific values, or affiliate them to predefined organizations.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Merge organizations aliases\
   The user interface now offers to merge two organizations when a user
   tries to add an alias that already belongs to a different one.
