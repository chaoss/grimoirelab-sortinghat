# Releases

## sortinghat 0.21.0 - (2024-03-01)

**New features:**

 * Dedicated queues in multi-tenancy\
   This new feature allows to run jobs in dedicated queues when multi-
   tenancy is active. Therefore, tenants that require more computing
   time, can run in a separate environment without taking the resources
   of others. This new feature changes the format of the `tenants.json`
   file, so please update it before you install this new version. You can
   find more info about how to configure it in the `README.md` file.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Match recommendations job fixed\
   Fix the bug in recommend matches jobs that was causing it not to
   recommend any matches.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Drop support of Node.js <18\
   Versions 14 to 16 of Node.js are no longer mantained. The current
   supported versions are 18 to 20.


## sortinghat 0.20.0 - (2024-02-19)

**New features:**

 * Organization aliases (#857)\
   Organizations can be known by different names. To avoid duplicates,
   organizations can have aliases. Searching for an organization using
   one of its aliases returns the organization. When an organization is
   merged into another, its name becomes an alias of the target
   organization. If a name exists as an alias, no organization can be
   created with that name and viceversa. An organization's aliases can be
   added and deleted both on the organizations table and the single
   organization view.


  ## sortinghat 0.19.2 - (2024-02-08)
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

## sortinghat 0.19.1 - (2024-02-01)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix "Table 'django_session' doesn't exist" error\
   Fixes the "Table 'django_session' doesn't exist" error for new
   installs. For existing databases, run the following commands to create
   the table: ``` django-admin migrate --fake sessions zero django-admin
   migrate ```


## sortinghat 0.19.0 - (2024-01-30)

**New features:**

 * Unify identities with same source\
   Include a new option to only recommend or unify identities from
   trusted sources like GitHub or GitLab that have the same username and
   backend.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Use correct base URL for login and change password API calls (#851)\
   The URLs called to login and change password now use the public path
   found in vue.config.js if no API URL is specified.
 * Authentication required fixed\
   When the AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED setting is set to False, any query to
   the API is allowed.
 * Display individual's most recent organization\
   The individual's current affiliation is now the most recent one
   instead of the oldest.
 * CSRF token is only required on web requests\
   The GraphQL API required the 'X-CSRFToken' header, but the token could
   only be retrieved by making a GET request. Now, requests authenticated
   using JWT don't need to provide the CSRF token and only the user
   interface, which is vulnerable to CSRF attacks and uses a different
   authentication, requires it.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance of organizations query\
   Improve organization query for the table by avoiding individual
   queries.


## sortinghat 0.18.0 - (2023-12-19)

**New features:**

 * Link to profile in individual cards (#837)\
   The name on the individuals cards now links to the member's profile.
 * Open calendar to the side of the date input (#838)\
   The date picker calendar that is used to edit affiliation dates now
   opens to the right side of the text field to avoid covering it.
 * Improved readability of job settings\
   The options for the "unify" and "recommend matches" jobs are now
   displayed in a clearer way.
 * Improved loading time when looking for organizations\
   The autocomplete field that is used to affiliate individuals to
   organizations now makes fewer and lighter requests to find them,
   resulting in faster loading times.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance on affiliation recommendations improved\
   We have improved the affiliation performance by one order of magnitude
   removing unnecessary queries to the database.


## sortinghat 0.17.0 - (2023-11-28)

**New features:**

 * Gitdm identities importer\
   New SortingHat identities importer for Gitdm format. This backend is
   configured with three parameters: a URL pointing to the file that
   matches emails with organizations, an optional URL for an aliases file
   that associates emails, and a flag for email validation to verify the
   validity of the provided email addresses.


## sortinghat 0.16.0 - (2023-11-17)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix individual page not loading\
   The individual's view was not loading when the workspace had not been
   used before or the cache was cleared.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Recommendations performance improved\
   Improve the recommendations performance by reducing the number of
   queries to the database and only generating recommendations between
   individuals that are directly related.


## sortinghat 0.15.0 - (2023-11-03)

**New features:**

 * Recommendations for individuals modified after a given date (#813)\
   Users can generate merge and affiliation recommendations for
   individuals that have been created or modified after a date specified
   with the `last_modified` parameter.
 * Add individual to workspace from their profile page (#816)\
   A new button on the individual's profile page allows users to save the
   identity in the workspace to continue working with it later on the
   dashboard.
 * Cache individuals table data (#821)\
   Using cached queries prevents the table from refetching all the data
   from the server everytime any information is edited. This is
   particularly helpful if there is a huge number of identities, where
   reloading the table is very slow. However, there are some cases when
   the queries need to be refetched, eg. when identities are merged or
   split.


## sortinghat 0.14.0 - (2023-10-20)

**New features:**

 * Strict criteria for merge recommendations (#812)\
   The merge recommendations filter out invalid email adresses and names
   that don't have at least a first and last name  when looking for
   matches. To disable this behavior, set the `strict` parameter on
   `recommendMatches` or `unify` to `false`.
 * Text field to update enrollment dates (#819)\
   Users have the option to enter the dates on a text field when editing
   affiliations.
 * Improved organization selector (#820)\
   The organization selector that is used to affiliate individuals now
   has the option to create an organization if the desired one is not
   found. Its size is also increased to improve the readability of longer
   names.
 * API method to create a scheduled task\
   The `add_scheduled_task` API method adds a new scheduled task to the
   registry.
 * Manage app settings from the user interface\
   Users can configure automatic affiliations, profile unification and
   identity data synchronization from the new `Settings` section on the
   user interface.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Remove tasks that fail to be scheduled\
   When there was an issue with the Redis connection when a task was
   created, the task was added to the database but there was not
   scheduled job linked to it. Tasks are  now removed from the database
   and an error is raised in this case.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Add Python 3.9 and drop 3.7 support\
   Python 3.7 reached the end of life phase on June 27 2023 and is no
   longer supported.


## sortinghat 0.13.0 - (2023-08-06)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Sub-domain affiliation error (#805)\
   The `affiliate` and `recommend affiliations` jobs no longer recommend
   matches based on a domain's sub-domains if it is not marked as
   `top_domain`.

**New deprecations:**

 * Use the task scheduler to import identities\
   Manage periodic tasks to import identities with the `scheduleTask`,
   `updateScheduledTask` and `deleteScheduledTask` GraphQL mutations. The
   tasks that were already scheduled using the `addImportIdentitiesTask`
   mutation are kept when the migrations are applied.


## sortinghat 0.12.0 - (2023-07-23)

**New features:**

 * Job scheduler\
   This new feature allows users to schedule jobs, such as `affiliate` or
   `unify`, to run periodically. The tasks can be configured, updated and
   deleted using the GraphQL API.


## sortinghat 0.11.1 - (2023-07-11)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Show an organization's members\
   Repeatedly clicking on the button to see the members of an
   organization or team on the table sometimes showed the full
   individuals list.


## sortinghat 0.11.0 - (2023-06-28)

**New features:**

 * Merge organizations (#571)\
   Merging organizations automatically moves all the domains, teams and
   enrollments to the target organization. This is helpful in case an
   organization has duplicates or if an organization absorbs another one.
   Organizations can be merged using drag and drop on the user interface.
 * Recommendations by individual (#779)\
   Users can generate matching recommendations for a specific individual
   by clicking on the drop down menu on each individual or on the
   individual's profile.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Show hidden buttons when the mouse is over the table row (#787)\
   The buttons to lock an individual or mark it as a bot were only
   visible when the mouse wass over the individual's name, which made it
   hard to find them. Now they appear when the mouse is over the table
   row.
 * Email affiliation error (#793)\
   Fix an error when the email domain ends with a dot, causing the
   affiliation process to stop.
 * ADD button doesn't affiliate individuals to organizations\
   Affiliating an individual to an organization using the "+ ADD" button
   on the table expanded view failed.
 * Enrollment filter on organizations view\
   Filtering individuals by their affiliation to an organization also
   returned results of organizations that contained that name. The filter
   now only returns organizations that match the exact name.


## sortinghat 0.10.0 - (2023-05-17)

**New features:**

 * Show when tables are loading (#772)\
   The individuals and organizations tables now show a progress bar to
   indicate that the items are loading.
 * Organization profiles\
   Each organization's full profile is available by clicking its name on
   the table or at `/organization/<organization name>`. This view shows
   the organization's teams, members and domains.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Sort jobs from newest to oldest (#769)\
   The jobs page now sorts the list from newest to oldest to show running
   jobs first.
 * Unreadable large numbers in pagination (#770)\
   Large page numbers were not fully visible in the tables pagination.
 * Edit a profile name with the pencil button (#773)\
   Clicking on an invidual's name no longer activates the edition mode.
   The name can now be edited with the pencil button.
 * Fix enrollment in individual's profile\
   In the individual's profile, the button to add an organization was not
   working.
 * Job timeouts\
   Jobs failed because they exceeded the default timeout while running
   tasks involving numerous identities. To ensure successful completion,
   we adjusted the timeout setting to an infinite duration, allowing jobs
   to finish without interruptions.

**Breaking changes:**

 * Multi-tenancy using headers\
   Tenants are now selected using the `sortinghat-tenant` header instead
   of the host. Proxies and clients using multi-tenancy should include
   that header.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Performance improved for recommendations and merging jobs\
   The performance of the matching and merging algorithms that are used
   on these jobs have been considerably improved. These jobs will be 4
   times faster than on the previous version.
 * uWSGI threads and workers\
   Include two new environments variables to define the number of threads
   and workers for uWSGI. These new variables are
   `SORTINGHAT_UWSGI_WORKERS` and `SORTINGHAT_UWSGI_THREADS`
 * SortingHat database performance\
   Improve SortingHat performance when there are a lot of individuals in
   the database.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Update dependencies\
   Include google-auth as a dependency to fix release issues.


## sortinghat 0.9.3 - (2023-04-28)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Tenant selection in job fixed\
   Tenant selection raised an error when the job context was defined as
   keyword argument.


## sortinghat 0.9.2 - (2023-04-27)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Static files not included in wheel package\
   SortingHat static files were not included in the Python package. The
   problem was in the GitHub action.


## sortinghat 0.9.1 - (2023-04-26)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Static files not included in wheel package\
   SortingHat static files were not included in the Python package.


## sortinghat 0.9.0 - (2023-04-21)

**New features:**

 * Set top domain from UI (#729)\
   Add the option to set an organization's domain as top domain from the
   UI.
 * Order individuals by indentities (#732)\
   Adds the option to order the individuals by the number of identities
   they have.
 * Import identities automatically (#746)\
   Create a schema to import identities to SortingHat automatically using
   custom backends. The jobs will be executed periodically, at the given
   interval.  The tasks can be configured using the GraphQL API.  To
   create a custom importer you need to extend `IdentitiesImporter`,
   define a `NAME` for your importer (that will be used in the UI), and
   implement `get_identities` method that returns a list of individuals
   with the related identities that will be imported into SortingHat. If
   your importer requires extra parameters, you must extend the
   `__init__` method with the required parameters. Those parameters can
   be defined using the API.
 * Create account command\
   Include a new command to create users in SortingHat. The command can
   be executed as `sortinghat-admin create-user`.
 * Drag and drop to enroll in teams\
   Expanding an organization on the table now shows the full list of
   teams. Individuals can be dragged and dropped into a team and
   viceversa to affiliate them. The buttons to add, edit and delete
   organization and team information are reorganized into a dropdown menu
   to simplify the interface.
 * Multi-tenancy mode\
   SortingHat allows hosting multiple instances with a single service
   having each instance's data isolated in different databases. To enable
   this feature follow these guidelines: - Set `MULTI_TENANT` settings to
   `True`. - Define the tenants in `sortinghat/config/tenants.json`. -
   Assign users to tenants with `sortinghat-admin set-user-tenant`
   command.
 * Verify SSL option for client\
   Include an option for the client to verify if the certificate is
   valid. By default it is verified.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Fix outdated recommendation count (#733)\
   The number of remaining recommendations on the UI was wrong each time
   a recommendation was applied or dismissed.
 * Fix search syntax link (#735)\
   Fixes the link to the search syntax page on the search bar.

**Feature removals:**

 * Groups table removed from the UI\
   Groups and organizations are very similar, and having both tables in
   the dashboard can be confusing to users. To simplify the view, the
   table is removed from the user interface, but groups remain available
   through the API.


  ## sortinghat 0.8.1 - (2023-02-03)
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies

## sortinghat 0.8.0 - (2023-02-01)

**New features:**

 * Migration command for SortingHat 0.7 (#726)\
   Include a new command to migrate SortingHat 0.7 database schema to
   0.8. The command can be executed as `sortinghat-admin migrate-old-
   database`. It will migrate all the data from the old version.

**Bug fixes:**

 * GraphQL client headers updated\
   SortingHat client headers are updated adding `Referer` and `Host` to
   fix the CSRF token issue.

**Breaking changes:**

 * SortingHat as a service\
   SortingHat started as a command line tool but, after some years, we
   saw its potential and we decided to create a new version of it. Now,
   it works as an individual service.  This new version provides a new
   GraphQL API to operate with the server and a UI web-based app, that
   replaces Hatstall, the old UI for SortingHat.  Moreover, the new
   version adds some features requested long time ago, such as
   groups/teams management, recommendations of affiliations and
   individuals, or a totally renwed user interface.


  ## sortinghat 0.7.23 - (2022-11-07)

   Update jinja2 package and dev-dependencies.


## Sorting Hat 0.7.20 - (2022-06-02)

**Bug fixes:**

 * [gitdm] Skip invalid format lines\
   Gitdm parser won't fail reading files with an invalid format. Instead,
   it will ignore invalid content.


## Sorting Hat 0.7 - (2018-10-02)

**NOTICE: Database schema generated by SortingHat < 0.7.0 is still
compatible but older versions can have problems inserting UTF-8
characters of 4 bytes.

Python 2.7 is no longer supported.

Please check "Compatibility between versions" section from README.md file.
**

** New features and improvements: **

 * Python 2.7 not longer supported

   As Python 2.x will not be maintained after 2020, SortingHat is only
   compatible with Python >= 3.4.

 * Low level API

   This API is able to execute basic operations over the database, such
   as adding or removing identities or finding entities. All these operations
   work within a session. Nothing is stored in the database until the
   session is closed. Thus, these functions can be considered as "bricks",
   that combined can create high-level functions.

 * Storage of UTF-8 4-bytes characters

   The default charset of UTF-8 (utf8) in MySQL/MariaDB does not support,
   even when they are part of the standard, 4-bytes long characters.
   This means characters like emojis or certain chinese characters cannot
   be inserted. Usually, identities names or usernames have these types of
   characters.

   The charset that fully supports UTF-8 is `utf8mb4` using the collation
   `utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci`. This collation implements the suggested Unicode
   Collation Algorithm (v5.2).

   Using `utf8mb4` also implies that the maximum size of char (VARCHAR and
   so on) columns is 191. Indexes cannot be larger than that when using
   InnoDB engine.

   Starting on 0.7 series, SortingHat is using this charset.

 * Handle disconnection using pessimistic mode

   SQLAlchemy offers a pessimistic mode to handle database disconnection.
   Setting `pool_pre_ping` parameter on the database engine will check if
   the database connection is still active when a session of the connection
   pool is reused. This causes a small hit in the performance but it's worth
   it.

 * Use a optimistic approach when inserting data

   With this optimistic approach, no more queries to check whether an entity
   exists on the database are run prior to its insertion.


## Sorting Hat 0.6 - (2018-03-05)

**NOTICE: Database schema generated by SortingHat < 0.6.0 are no longer
compatible. Please check "Compatibility between versions" section from
README.md file**

** New features and improvements: **

 * Gender.

   Unique identities gender can be set in the profile using the command
   `profile` and data will be stored in the table of the same name. This table
   adds two new fields: `gender`, a free text field to set the gender
   value, and `gender_acc`, to set the accuracy of the gender - in a range
   of 1 to 100 - when it is set using automatic options.

   The new command `autogender` has also been added. It assigns a gender
   to each unique identity using the name of the profile and the information
   provided by `http://genderize.io`. Possible values are *male* or *female*.

 * Option for reusing a database.

   An existing database can be reused when `init` command is called. So far,
   when the database was already created, this command raised an exception.

 * Version option.

   Calling `sortinghat` with the option `-v | --version` prints the version
   of `sortinghat` running on the system.

 * Tests improvements.

   Some minor changes were done in the testing area. The main ones were to
   support MariaDB engine and to use a remote testing database.


## Sorting Hat 0.5 - (2017-12-21)

**NOTICE: Database schema generated by SortingHat < 0.5.0 are no longer
compatible. Please check "Compatibility between versions" section from
README.md file**

** New features and improvements: **

 * Last modification.

   Unique identities and identities log the last time they were modified
   by adding, deleting, moving, merging, updating the profile, adding
   or removing enrollments operations.

   The new `search_last_modified_identities` API function allows to search
   for the UUIDs of those identities modified on or after a given date.

 * No strict matching option.

   This option allows to avoid a rigorous validation of values while
   matching identities, for instance, with well formed email addresses
   or names with first name and last name. This option is available on
   `load` and `unify` commands.

 * Reset option while loading.

   Before loading any data, if `reset` option is set, all the relationships
   between identities and their enrollments will be removed from the
   database.

 * GrimoireLab support.

   GrimoireLab identities and organizations YAML files can be converted
   to Sorting Hat JSON format using the script `grimoirelab2sh`.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Fix tables created with invalid collation. In some random situations
   Sorting Hat tables appear with an invalid collation. This is related
   to a wrong generation of the DDL table statement by SQLAlchemy, which
   may randomly prepend the collation information (`MYSQL_COLLATE`) to
   the charset one (`MYSQL_CHARSET`), causing the former to be ignored.
   Changing `MYSQL_CHARSET` to `MYSQL_DEFAULT_CHARSET` fixed the problem.

 * Remove trailing whitespaces in exported JSON files. This error is only
   found in Python 2.7 due to a bug in the standard library with
   `json.dump()` and `indent` parameter. (#103)

 * Update profile information when loading identities. So far, profile
   information was set only the first time a unique identity was loaded.
   With this change, it will be updated always, except when the given
   profile is empty


## Sorting Hat 0.4 - (2017-07-17)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Mailmap and StackAlytics support.

   Mailmap and StackAlytics files can be converted to Sorting Hat JSON
   format using the new scripts `mailmap2sh` and `stackalytics2sh`.

 * Unify by sources.

   Giving a list of sources, this option allows to `unify` command to
   merge only those unique identities which belong to any of the given
   sources.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Encoding error generating UUIDs in Python 3. Some special characters
   cannot be encoded in Python3. This caused function `uuid()` to fail
   when converting those characters. 'surrogateescape' handler was
   added to fix that problem.

 * Force `utf8_unicode_ci` collation on MySQL tables to fix integrity errors.
   MySQL considers chars like `β` and `b` or `ı` and `i` the same, when
   some collation values are set (i.e `utf8_general_ci`). This can raise
   integrity errors when Sorting Hat tries to add similar identities with
   these pairs of characters.

   For instance, if the identity:

       ('scm', 'βart', 'bart@example.com', 'bart)

   is stored in the database, the insertion of:

       ('scm', 'bart', 'bart@example.com', 'bart)

   will raise an error, even when these identities have different UUIDs.
   Forcing MySQL to use `utf8_unicode_ci` fixes this error, allowing
   to insert both identities.


## Sorting Hat 0.3 - (2017-03-21)

**NOTICE: UUIDs generated by SortingHat < 0.3.0 are no longer compatible.
Please check "Compatibility between versions" section from README.md file**

** New features and improvements: **

 * New algorithm to genere UUIDs.

   UUIDs were generated using case and accent sensitive values with the seed
   `(source:email:name:username)`. This means that for any identity with the
   same values in lower or upper case (i.e: `jsmith@example.com` and `JSMITH@example.com`)
   or with the same values accent or unaccent (i.e: `John Smith` or `Jöhn Smith`)
   would have different UUIDs for any of these combinations.

   The new algorithm changes upper to lower case characters and converts accent
   characters to their canonical form before the UUIDs is generated.

   This change is caused by the behaviour of MySQL with case configurations
   and accent and unaccent characters. MySQL considers those characters the same,
   raising `IntegrityError` exceptions when similar tuple values are inserted
   into the database. Generating the same UUID for these cases will prevent the
   error.

   Take into account that previous UUIDs are no longer compatible with this
   version of SortingHat. You should regenerate the UUIDs following the steps
   described in section *Compatibility between versions* from `README.md` file.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Any non-empty value in email field was used during the affiliation. This
   caused some errors for non valid email addresses like with 'email@' cases,
   which raised a `IndexError` exception. This bug has been fixed using valid
   email addresses only during the affiliation.

 * Invalid database names were allowed in `init` command.


## Sorting Hat 0.2 - (2017-02-01)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Auto complete profile information with `autoprofile` command.

   This command autocompletes the profiles information related to a set of unique
   identities. To update the profile, the command uses a list of sources ordered
   by priority. Only those unique identities which have one or more identities
   from any of these sources will be updated. The name of the profile will be
   filled using the best name possible, normally the longest one.

 * GiHub identities matching method.

   This new method tries to find equal identities using those identities from
   GitHub sources. The identities must come from a source starting with a `github`
   label and the usernames must be equal.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * The parser for Gitdm files only accepted email addresses as valid aliases.
   This has been modified to accept any type of aliases. Thus, the input file
   passed to `gidm2sh` script will be a list of valid aliases instead of email
   aliases.
