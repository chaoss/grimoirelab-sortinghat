    The command list a set of enrollments. Some searching parameters
    to filter the results are available. Parameters <uuid> and <organization>
    filter by unique identity and organization name. Enrollments between a
    period can also be listed using <from> and <to> parameters, where
    <from> must be less or equal than <to>. Default values for these dates
    are '1900-01-01' and '2100-01-01'.

    Dates may follow several patterns. The most common and recommended
    is 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Optionally, time information can be included using
    patters like 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'.
