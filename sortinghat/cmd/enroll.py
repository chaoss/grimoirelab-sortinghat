    This command enrolls a unique identity, identified by <uuid>,

    The period of the enrollment can be set with --from and --to parameters,
    where --from must be less or equal than --to. Default values for these
    dates are '1900-01-01' and '2100-01-01'.

    information can be included using patters like 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'.

    Setting the option --merge will merge overlapped enrollments related
