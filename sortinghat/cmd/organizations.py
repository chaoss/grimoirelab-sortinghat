    By default, this command lists the organizations and domains existing
    in the registry. If <term> is given, the method will list only
    those organizations that match with that term.

    Organizations and domains can be added to the registry using '--add'
    option. This will add the given <organization> or <domain>, but not
    both at the same time. When <organization> is the only parameter given,
    it will be added to the registry. When both parameters are given,
    the command will assign <domain> to <organization>. Note: <organization>
    must exists before adding a domain.

    A domain can only be assigned to one company. Use '--overwrite' to to create
    a new relationship. In this case, previous <domain> relationship will be
    removed.

    New domains can be also set as a top domains using '--top-domain' flag. That is
    useful to avoid the insertion of sub-domains that belong to the same organization
    (i.e eu.example.com, us.example.com). Take into account when 'overwrite' is set
    it will also update 'top_domain' flag even when this flag were not set.

    To delete organizations use '--delete' option. When <organization> is the only
    parameter given, it will be removed from the registry, including those domains
    related to it. When both <domain> and <organization> are given, only the domain
    will be deleted.

    Database connection parameters are required to run this command.
