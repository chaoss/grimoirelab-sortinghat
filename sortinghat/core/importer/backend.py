    Base class for importers that fetch identities from a URL.

    To avoid a :class:`NotImplementedError`, derived classes have to implement
    or define:
     - :func:`get_individuals`, that returns a list of individuals with
        their identities.
     - :func:`__init__` (optional), with the required arguments that will
        be asked for the user in the UI.
     - :data:`NAME`, to define the name of the backend used for the UI.

    After importing the identities, they can be post processed by
    implementing the method `post_process_individual`. For example,
    you might want to merge the imported identities with others already
    existing using custom criteria, or to set the profile of the new identities
    in using specific values, or affiliate them to predefined organizations.
