    This command adds a new identity to the registry. By default,

    new identity.

    The registry considers that two identities are distinct when
    any value of the tuple (<source>, <email>, <name>, <username>)
    is different. For example, the identities:

    \b
      * ('scm', 'jsmith@example.com', 'John Smith', 'jsmith')
      * ('mls', 'jsmith@example.com', 'John Smith', 'jsmith')

    will be registered as different identities.

    When <uuid> parameter is set, it creates a new identity that
    will be linked to the individual defined by <uuid>.
    Take into account <uuid> must exist before adding the new
    identity.

    To add a new identity, at least one of <email>, <name>, or
    <username> must be provided. The default value for <source>
    is "unknown".
