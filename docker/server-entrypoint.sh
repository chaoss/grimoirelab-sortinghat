#
# Script to run SortingHat service inside of a container.
#
# By default, it takes configuration settings from
# 'sortinghat.config.settings' module.
#
# It also configures the service when it is not initialized
# (i.e. when the database defined in the settings wasn't created yet).
# A superuser will be created during the setup, which requires to pass
# SORTINGHAT_SUPERUSER_USERNAME and SORTINGHAT_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD
# environment variables to configure this super user.
#
# When the flag '--upgrade' is set, it will update the database to its
# last version applying new migrations and fixtures. It will also update
# the UI interface files.
#
# To run the service in developer mode use the flag '--dev'. This will
# start a HTTP server you can access in port 8000. You can also use
# UWSGI_HTTP env var to define where you want to start the service.
